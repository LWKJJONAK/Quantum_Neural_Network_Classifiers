# Quantum Neural Network Classifiers

An implementation of quantum neural network (QNN) classifiers

![](assets/framework.png)

## Setup

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/LWKJJONAK/Quantum_Neural_Network_Classifiers
$ cd Quantum_Neural_Network_Classifiers
$ julia --project=amplitude_encode -e "using Pkg; Pkg.instantiate()"
$ julia --project=block_encode -e "using Pkg; Pkg.instantiate()"
```

Then the environments for the codes provided in jupyter notebook formats will be built.

Note: In order to use PyPlot, you will need to have the Python [Matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/)
library installed on your machine first.

In case you have a dark background, change the line and text color of YaoPlots.plot:
```bash
CircuitStyles.textcolor[]="yellow"
CircuitStyles.linecolor[]="yellow"
```
(Here, we acknowledge the valuable input from Dr. Erlebacher)

In addition, for better compatibility, use version 1.7 or higher of Julia.

## Data

In the paper [Quantum Neural Network Classifiers: A Tutorial](https://www.scipost.org/SciPostPhysLectNotes.61), we provide 5 Tables to exhibit the benchmarks. In addition to the average accuracy provided in this paper, in the complete data files, we also record the learning rate, the batch size, the number of iterations, the size of the training and test sets, and the accuracy/loss curves during the training process. The quick link is shown here: (the code for this part will not be updated, since in these links we have provided all the 55000 data files recording the numerical results)

## Motivation

Over the recent years, quantum neural network models have attracted a lot of attention and explorations. One major direction of QNNs is to handle classification tasks. Here, we divide QNN classifiers into two categories according to the ways of data encoding as exhibited in the figure above:

- The amplitude encoding strategy is suitable for the situations where we have a quantum random access memory (QRAM) to fetch the data, or the data directly comes from a quantum process (natural quantum data).
- The block encoding strategy is suitable for the situations where we have to encode the classical data into the QNN models.

## Built With

* [Yao](https://github.com/QuantumBFS/Yao.jl) - A framework for Quantum Algorithm Design

Detailed installation instructions and tutorials of Julia and Yao.jl can be found at [julialang.org](https://julialang.org/) and [yaoquantum.org](https://yaoquantum.org/), respectively.
